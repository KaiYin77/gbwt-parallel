# GBWT

Graph BWT is an independent implementation of the graph extension (gPBWT) of the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT). Its initial purpose is to embed observed haplotypes in a [variation graph](https://github.com/vgteam/vg). Haplotypes are essentially sequences of nodes in the variation graph, and GBWT is best seen as the multi-string BWT of the node sequences.

The implementation uses [Succinct Data Structure Library 2.0](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite) (SDSL). Before compiling, set `SDSL_DIR` in the Makefile to point to your SDSL directory. As the implementation uses C++11, OpenMP, and libstdc++ parallel mode, you need g++ 4.9 or newer to compile. On Apple systems, GBWT can also be built with Apple Clang 9.1, but libomp must be installed via Macports or Homebrew, and the lack of libstdc++'s parallel mode extensions will result in slower index construction.

To compile, simply run `make`. Use `install.sh` to compile GBWT and install the headers and library to your home directory, or `install.sh prefix` to specify another install prefix.

GBWT is compiled with `-DNDEBUG` by default. Using this option is highly recommended. There are several cases, where SDSL code works correctly but the assertions are incorrect. As SDSL 2.0 is no longer actively supported, we have to wait until the release of SDSL 3.0 to fix these issues.
