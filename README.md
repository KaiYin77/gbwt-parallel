# GBWT

Graph BWT is an independent implementation of the graph extension (gPBWT) of the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT). Its initial purpose is to embed observed haplotypes in a [variation graph](https://github.com/vgteam/vg). Haplotypes are essentially sequences of nodes in the variation graph, and GBWT is best seen as the multi-string BWT of the node sequences.

The implementation uses [Succinct Data Structures Library 2.0](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite) (SDSL). To compile, set `SDSL_DIR` in the Makefile to point to your SDSL directory. As the implementation uses C++11, OpenMP, and libstdc++ parallel mode, you need g++ 4.7 or newer to compile.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/jltsiren/gbwt/wiki) for further documentation.
